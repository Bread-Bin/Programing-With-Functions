How to write variables in Python

	variable = "value of said variable"


\   treat next character diffrently
	good for including ' or " into a print text  (gramer)

\n  to put text onto new line in the terminal



{EXAMPLE OF HOW TO FORMAT TEXT}
words = "the cat IN THE hat"		the cat IN THE hat
words.capitalize()			The cat in the hat
words.title()				The Cat In The Hat
words.upper()				THE CAT IN THE HAT
words.lower()				the cat in the hat
words.count("t")				3
words.lower().count("t")		4


MATH

x = 5
y = 2

print(x + y)

z = int("5")
int allows you to change one value type to another: text to numerical.
helpful when taking user input in the terminal   ie:
x = int(input("How old are you: ))

Floating Point:
used for decimals
x = float(input("enter in a number: ))

Number to String:
y = str(2)
